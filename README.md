# hello-world
This is for me to get started using GitHub.
I want to learn more about programming. I havenÂ´t done much of that since around 1984 when I took a course where we used Pascal (does that even exist any more...?).
I now work together with developers and I need to understand more of what they do and understand their lingo.
